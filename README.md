## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is designed to provide a standardized way for applications to convey contextual information relevant to authorization decisions. These SDKs facilitate the integration of MCP with Asgardeo in Node.js applications.

-   **MCP Express (@brionmario-experimental/mcp-express)**: Middleware specifically tailored for Express.js applications to seamlessly integrate MCP-based authorization.
-   **MCP Node (@brionmario-experimental/mcp-node)**: Core functionalities and utilities for MCP, which can be used in various Node.js environments. The Express middleware may utilize or depend on this core package.

For detailed installation and usage instructions for each package, please refer to the README file within its respective directory (e.g., `packages/mcp-express/README.md`).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Node.js `16.x` or later
- pnpm `8.x` or later (or your preferred package manager like npm/yarn, though pnpm is often used in monorepos)

## Development

To get started with development:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/brionmario/asgardeo-mcp-node.git](https://github.com/brionmario/asgardeo-mcp-node.git)
    cd asgardeo-mcp-node
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    If you are using pnpm and have a workspace setup:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
    This will typically install dependencies for all packages in the monorepo.

3.  **Build packages:**
    You will likely have a root-level build command or individual build commands per package. Example using pnpm workspaces:
    ```bash
    pnpm run build
    # or to build a specific package
    # pnpm --filter @brionmario-experimental/mcp-express run build
    ```

Please refer to the `package.json` scripts and individual package READMEs for more detailed development commands.
